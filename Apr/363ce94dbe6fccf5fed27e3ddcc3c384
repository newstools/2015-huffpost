Easter isn’t exactly the most raucous of holidays. Christmas has its eggnog, Thanksgiving has its boozy football-watching drinks, and the Fourth of July has ice-cold beer. But Easter? It’s never traditionally been a day for imbibing, unless you count a sip of wine at the Easter Sunday communion service. Enter, jello egg shots. It’s a jello shot, in the shape of an egg. With the aid of Jell-O Jigglers egg molds (remember them from the days of yore?) and the liquor of your choice, you can be well on your way to sucking down some juicy goodness in no time. Watch the video above for a demonstration. To make 6 jello egg shots: INGREDIENTS 1 box of flavored gelatin 1 packet of Knox unflavored gelatin 1 cup water 1 cup liquor SUPPLIES Jell-O Jigglers egg mold (6 eggs) Spray canola oil Funnel INSTRUCTIONS Boil water. Pour entire package of flavored gelatin and packet of unflavored Knox gelatin into a medium-sized bowl. Add boiling water and liquor to the bowl. Mix powders with liquids until everything is fully dissolved. Allow mixture to cool to room temperature, about 10 minutes. Spray the egg molds with a light coating of canola oil, to prevent sticking. Stir the mixture again to loosen up any clumps of gelatin. Now pour the mixture through a funnel into each of the 6 egg molds, filling up just to the top. Refrigerate 3 hours, until fully set. To unmold, gently pry the molds open with a table knife, and use a knife or spoon to help ease the eggs out of the molds. Cheers! Note: To make stripes, mix up different colors/flavors of gelatin in separate bowls. Pour one color at a time into the mold, to your desired thickness, and let set for about 20 minutes in the refrigerator before pouring in the next layer. Repeat until filled.
